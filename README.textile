h1. Introduction

A reusable Django application to create a proxy object for your models. 
Intended to aggregate various content types into a model for reuse.

h2. Dependencies

Nothing external. No contrib apps. Just Django proper.

h2. TODO

* Allowing passing a callable for `active` business logic handling
* Decouple further via signals possibly, removing ProxyMeta from the design

h3. Examples

To see this project in use, take a peek at "Django-Mingus":http://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus and how combined with django-basic-apps it leverages the solution.
